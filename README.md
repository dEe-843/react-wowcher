This is my assignment project for Wisdom Leaf Technologies Ltd. called Revenue aggregator application, using React.

This project is a React application that fetches product data from multiple branches and displays it in a table. 
The table provides details about each product, including its name and total revenue from sales. 
The application includes functionalities to merge products from different branches, sort the products alphabetically, and filter them by name.

Features:
--> Fetches product data from three different branches using the Fetch API. 
--> Merges products from all branches, summing up the total revenue for each product.
--> Displays the data in a table where each row shows the product name and total revenue. 
--> Allows sorting of products alphabetically by name.
--> Provides a case-insensitive filter to search products by name.
--> Calculates and displays the total revenue of all displayed products.
